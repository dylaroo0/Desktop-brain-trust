# BrainTrust Circle: Vision Statement
## Transforming Human–AI Collaboration Through User Empowerment

### Our Vision
We envision a world where every person can create their own perfect AI collaboration environment — not just use AI tools, but design the entire workspace around their unique needs, workflows, and creative processes.

BrainTrust Circle empowers people to move from being AI users to becoming AI workspace creators. We center everything around a shared conversation where participants take turns, build on each other’s ideas, and easily convert discussion into structured outcomes like summaries, task lists, calendars, and plans. A capable Super Organizer assistant coordinates the work, while a large ecosystem of specialist agents provides focused expertise on demand.


### The Transformation

**From AI Users to AI Workspace Creators**

Today, people are limited by what AI companies decide to build. They’re trapped in walled gardens with rigid interfaces that don’t adapt to individual needs. Users must conform to the software, rather than software conforming to users.

BrainTrust Circle changes this dynamic. We’re building a platform where users are the architects of their AI collaboration experience. With the help of a Super Organizer assistant, anyone can create specialists, teams, and workflows. Every color, layout, workflow, and interaction is under user control. People don’t just use BrainTrust Circle — they create their own version of it.

### The Four Pillars of Transformation

#### 1. One Shared Conversation Feed, Multiple AI Perspectives
Instead of juggling separate chats with different AI services, users orchestrate a unified conversation where multiple AI specialists contribute on demand. One conversation thread, multiple specialized perspectives — conducted and led by the user. The system timestamps decisions, produces summaries, updates calendars, and archives everything for future reference.

#### 2. Super Organizer/Admin Assistant
An advanced assistant that doesn’t just respond to questions — it orchestrates projects, maintains cross-conversation context, creates task lists, manages calendars, and coordinates with external systems. Your digital partner that never sleeps.

The Super Organizer can:
- Intelligent project orchestration: “Create a priority list based on this chat and save it to the calendar.”
- Manage multiple workflows with stages, deadlines, and dependencies
- Preserve context across projects and teams
- Summarize discussions, timestamp decisions, and persist agreed actions
- Help design entire project templates and multi-stage workflows
- Coordinate specialist agents as needed

#### 3. Bring Your Own AI Subscriptions (Walled Gardens)
Bring your existing AI subscriptions (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and others) into the shared conversation via extensions and connectors. No more switching between different AI websites. Leverage current investments while gaining the power of multi‑AI collaboration.

#### 4. Specialist Ecosystem: 899+ AI Experts
Access hyper‑focused AI specialists with narrow expertise across domains — from creative writing to software development, legal analysis to financial planning. Each specialist is defined by a lightweight JSON profile, making them easy to store, edit, and customize. Example:

```json
{
  "agentname": "Github Repo Finder",
  "description": "Recommends GitHub repositories to users based on their interests.",
  "systemprompt": "You are a helpful assistant whose task is to identify GitHub repositories on a specific subject for the user. You have access to a crawling tool which you can use to discover GitHub repositories. \n\nWhen a user asks you to find GitHub repos, use your crawling tool to identify five projects that closely match the user's request, focusing on projects that are gaining traction, are popular, and established.\n\nFor each of the five projects that you identify, respond to the user with the following information:\n- A short description of the project.\n- The number of stars the project has.\n- A link to the repository.",

Offer the following types of lists:\n\n*   Essentials List: A list of must-have items.\n*   Weekly Stock-Up List: A comprehensive list for the week's groceries.\n*   Other Variants: Be responsive to the user's specific requests.\n\nFor each shopping list, offer the user the following format options:\n\n*   Text List: One item per line.\n*   Markdown List: Formatted with markdown.\n*   CSV: Comma-separated values.\n\nIf the user opts for CSV, provide the list within a code fence.\n\nIf the user opts for text or markdown, ask the user whether they'd prefer to have it:\n\n*   Directly in the conversation.\n*   In a code fence.\n\nAlways ask the user whether they would like the grocery list to be categorized, e.g., by grouping common groceries into specific sections (produce, dairy, meat, etc.).\n\nProvide the grocery list in the user's preferred format, categorized if requested.",
