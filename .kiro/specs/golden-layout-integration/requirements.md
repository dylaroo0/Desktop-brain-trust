# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Golden Layout into the Electron React Boilerplate application to provide movable and resizable panels in a WorkspaceLayout component. Golden Layout is a multi-window layout manager for webapps that provides drag-and-drop functionality, resizable panels, and persistent layout configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Electron React Boilerplate, I want to install Golden Layout with proper TypeScript support, so that I can use it without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Golden Layout is installed THEN the package SHALL be available in node_modules with TypeScript definitions
2. WHEN the application is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors related to Golden Layout
3. WHEN Golden Layout is imported THEN it SHALL work with the existing Electron React Boilerplate build system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a WorkspaceLayout component that uses Golden Layout, so that I can have movable and resizable panels in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WorkspaceLayout component is created THEN it SHALL initialize Golden Layout properly
2. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL display panels that can be moved and resized
3. WHEN panels are manipulated THEN the layout SHALL persist the changes
4. WHEN the component is integrated with the existing App.tsx THEN it SHALL render without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want to interact with movable and resizable panels, so that I can customize my workspace layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a panel tab THEN the panel SHALL move to the new location
2. WHEN I drag panel borders THEN the panel SHALL resize accordingly
3. WHEN I close a panel THEN it SHALL be removed from the layout
4. WHEN I refresh the application THEN the layout SHALL maintain its previous state
