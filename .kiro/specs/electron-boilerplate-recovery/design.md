# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to recover the missing webpack configuration files in the Electron React Boilerplate while preserving existing custom work. The approach focuses on selective restoration rather than complete project deletion.

## Architecture

### Recovery Strategy

```
Current Broken Project
├── Missing .erb/configs/ (webpack configs)
├── Existing Custom Work (preserve)
├── Existing Specs (preserve)
└── Node Modules (reinstall)

Fresh Reference Project
├── Complete .erb/configs/ (copy from here)
├── Complete package.json (compare/merge)
└── Complete build scripts (reference)
```

### Preservation Strategy

- **Specs Directory**: Complete preservation of .kiro/specs/
- **Custom Components**: Preserve src/renderer/app/components/
- **Custom Pages**: Preserve any modified pages
- **Configuration**: Merge custom configs with restored defaults

## Components and Interfaces

### File Recovery Process

```typescript
interface RecoveryPlan {
  preserve: string[];  // Files/directories to keep
  restore: string[];   // Files to copy from fresh install
  merge: string[];     // Files that need manual merging
  reinstall: string[]; // Dependencies to reinstall
}
```

### Backup Strategy

```typescript
interface BackupManifest {
  timestamp: string;
  preservedFiles: string[];
  customComponents: string[];
  specFiles: string[];
}
```

## Data Models

### Recovery Checklist

```typescript
interface RecoveryStep {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'backup' | 'restore' | 'verify' | 'merge';
  files: string[];
  completed: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### File Conflicts
- Compare existing custom files with fresh boilerplate
- Create backup copies before any overwrites
- Provide merge strategies for configuration conflicts

### Dependency Issues
- Clear node_modules completely before reinstall
- Verify package.json integrity
- Handle version conflicts between custom and boilerplate dependencies

### Build Verification
- Test compilation after each major restoration step
- Verify all webpack configs are properly linked
- Ensure TypeScript compilation works end-to-end

## Testing Strategy

### Recovery Verification
- Verify all missing webpack config files are restored
- Test that npm install completes successfully
- Confirm npm start launches without errors

### Preservation Verification
- Verify all spec files remain intact and readable
- Confirm custom components are still accessible
- Test that existing work integrates with restored build system

### Integration Testing
- Test complete build pipeline from TypeScript to Electron
- Verify hot reload functionality works
- Confirm production build process functions correctly
