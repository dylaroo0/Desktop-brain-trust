# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the missing webpack configuration files in the Electron React Boilerplate project that are preventing the application from building and running. The goal is to restore the missing build configuration while preserving existing custom work and specs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restore the missing webpack configuration files, so that the Electron React Boilerplate can build and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the .erb/configs directory is checked THEN it SHALL contain all required webpack configuration files
2. WHEN npm start is executed THEN the application SHALL build without "Cannot find module" errors
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL display the default Electron React Boilerplate interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve my existing custom work during the recovery process, so that I don't lose progress on features like golden-layout-integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recovery process is completed THEN existing spec files SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN the recovery process is completed THEN custom components in src/renderer/app SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the recovery process is completed THEN any custom configuration files SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the recovered build system works correctly, so that I can continue development with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install is executed THEN all dependencies SHALL install without errors
2. WHEN npm start is executed THEN the development server SHALL start successfully
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL render the default counter page without errors
4. WHEN TypeScript files are compiled THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors
