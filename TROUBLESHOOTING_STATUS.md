| New (working) | ✅ | `braintrust-circle` | Electron-Vite, ESLint v9, 0 vulnerabilities |

## 🔧 MIGRATION READINESS
| Component | Status | Source | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Main Process | ✅ | New project | Ready for use |
| Specialist Library | ❌ | Old project | Needs audit + migration |
| Chat Feed | ❌ | Old project | Needs audit + migration |
| Super Organizer | ❌ | Old project | Needs audit + migration |

## �� IMMEDIATE TASKS
1. [ ] **Audit old project components** - Check what exists and viability
2. [ ] **Identify Electron-compatible components** - Separate web vs desktop ready
3. [ ] **Plan migration strategy** - Which components to migrate first
4. [ ] **Start with minimal viable app** - Core functionality only

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
- **DO NOT** try to fix the old broken project
- **DO NOT** migrate components without viability assessment
- **FOCUS** on building in the new working Electron-Vite project
- **ESTIMATE** 90% of components may need desktop adaptation

## 🔄 STOP CONDITIONS
- DO NOT return to broken Webpack setup
- DO NOT migrate broken components
- DO NOT add features until core migration is stable

> 🎯 **Goal**: Minimal workable desktop app using working foundation
> 💡 **Strategy**: Audit → Plan → Migrate → Build

## WHAT USER WANTS

- **Modular components** that work standalone
- **User controls everything** - colors, layout, positioning
- **Nothing locked in** - fresh start approach
- **Dockable panels** that can be moved/resized

## CRITICAL: DON'T GO ON A CODING TEAR

- User wants **troubleshooting first**
- Test the fix before building new features
- If troubleshooting takes longer than rebuilding, pivot to standalone modules
- User has all the code already

## NEXT ACTION

1. Try `npm start` once
2. If it works: great, continue
3. If it fails: consider restart or fresh approach
4. **STOP and ask user** before doing anything else

## USER'S FRUSTRATION

- Kiro keeps trying to do too much instead of focusing
- Needs clean handoffs between sessions
- Wants systematic troubleshooting, not random fixes
