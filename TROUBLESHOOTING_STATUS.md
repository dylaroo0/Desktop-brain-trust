# STATUS FOR NEXT KIRO SESSION

## WHERE WE ARE

- **Problem**: Electron app won't start - `Cannot access 'electron_1' before initialization`
- **Found**: `src/main/main.ts` was corrupted (only contained text "main.ts")
- **Fixed**: Restored proper Electron main process code
- **Status**: **UNTESTED** - need to run `npm start` to see if it works

## WHAT USER WANTS

- **Modular components** that work standalone
- **User controls everything** - colors, layout, positioning
- **Nothing locked in** - fresh start approach
- **Dockable panels** that can be moved/resized

## CRITICAL: DON'T GO ON A CODING TEAR

- User wants **troubleshooting first**
- Test the fix before building new features
- If troubleshooting takes longer than rebuilding, pivot to standalone modules
- User has all the code already

## NEXT ACTION

1. Try `npm start` once
2. If it works: great, continue
3. If it fails: consider restart or fresh approach
4. **STOP and ask user** before doing anything else

## USER'S FRUSTRATION

- Kiro keeps trying to do too much instead of focusing
- Needs clean handoffs between sessions
- Wants systematic troubleshooting, not random fixes
